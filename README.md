# ESP8266 adaptor PCB
The ESP8266 is readily available in many different 'module' packages and three of the most commmon are the so-called v0.9, v1.0 and v3, but whilst the v0.9 and v3 have the same pin spacing it is different for v1.0

This adaptor PCB can be used to 'translate' between v1.0 and v0.9 or v3 ESP8266 modules so that if a connection 'expects' (say) a v1.0, then a v0.9 or v3 van be inserted instead, although obviously any logical changes in the pin usage must be made to the associated software usage.

The images below show the two sides of the PCB design, and gerber files for the PCB design can be downloaded from the PCB_design_files folder.
